        <h1 class="mb-4">Contribute to EugDotNet</h1>
        <p class="lead">We welcome all kinds of contributions — code, design, content, or simply showing up and giving feedback. Here's how to get involved:</p>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h5>1. Join the Conversation</h5>
            <p>The best way to stay in the loop is through our <a href="https://discord.gg/YOURINVITELINK" target="_blank">Discord server</a>. Introduce yourself, ask questions, or suggest new ideas — it’s low-key and collaborative.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h5>2. Check Out the GitHub Repo</h5>
            <p>Find an issue, fork the repo, and start exploring! We use standard branching and PR workflows. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/Dfreem/DotnetMeetup" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> to get started.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h5>3. Not a Coder? That’s Cool</h5>
            <p>We’re also looking for help with UI/UX, documentation, accessibility, copywriting, testing, and more. If you care about community and clarity, we’d love to hear from you.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h5>4. Still Not Sure Where to Start?</h5>
            <p>That’s totally fine. Reach out to <strong>Joel</strong> on Discord or LinkedIn, or come to a meetup and chat. We’re figuring this out together — and we’re glad you’re here.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <h5>🎤 Want to Give a Talk?</h5>
            <p>We’re always looking for community talks — short or long, beginner or advanced. <a href="/contribute/talk">Propose a talk</a> and we’ll be in touch!</p>
